    <p class="font-under-image">Everything about us that we do is rooted in sport. Sport plays an increasingly important role in more and more peoples lives, on and off the field of play. It is central to every culture and society and is core to our health and happiness.
                         Key to our success and the execution of our strategy Own the Game, are our people and our culture. They bring our identity to life, defined by our purpose, mission, and attitude.
                     Our purpose, through sport, we have the power to change lives, guides the way we run our company, how we work with our partners, how we create our products, and how we engage with our consumers. We will always strive to expand the limits of human possibilities, to include and unite people in sport, and to create a more sustainable world.  
             To experience how our employees and partners are driving change through purpose and how you can find purpose, too</p>
